Catering Reservation and Ordering System
Overview
The Catering Reservation and Ordering System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of making catering reservations, placing orders, and managing event catering requests for businesses, events, or private gatherings. The system allows customers to choose catering options, customize their menu, reserve a catering service for a specific date, and track the status of their order.

This system is ideal for catering companies, event planners, and venues that require an easy-to-use interface for both customers and administrators to handle orders and reservations efficiently.
